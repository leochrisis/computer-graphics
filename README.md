Repository to keep files of CG from UFPA

I don't know why, but if you wanna work on this repo, have in mind that 
all the things here are made with .js and (just a few things) in Python.
So remember to install Node.js (and if you don't have, Python 3).

Ps: In some codes I used OpenCV, so please, have It in mind too.
